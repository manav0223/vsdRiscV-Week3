## Objectives

- Learn and perform **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** on VSDBabySoC.  
- Understand **timing paths, setup and hold checks, slack analysis**, and constraints.  
- Perform **SPEF analysis** for back-annotated parasitic delay verification.  
- Analyze **critical paths, arrival/required times, and timing margins**.  
- Explore timing libraries and constraints for accurate STA.
